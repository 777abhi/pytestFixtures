In Python, operators are special symbols that carry out arithmetic or logical computation. Here's a brief overview of the main types of operators in Python with examples:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**:
   - Used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.
   - Example:
     ```python
     # Addition
     print(5 + 3)  # Output: 8

     # Subtraction
     print(5 - 3)  # Output: 2

     # Multiplication
     print(5 * 3)  # Output: 15

     # Division
     print(5 / 3)  # Output: 1.666...
     ```

2. **Comparison Operators**:
   - Used to compare values. It either returns `True` or `False` according to the condition.
   - Example:
     ```python
     # Equal to
     print(5 == 3)  # Output: False

     # Not equal to
     print(5 != 3)  # Output: True

     # Greater than
     print(5 > 3)  # Output: True
     ```

3. **Logical Operators**:
   - Used to combine conditional statements.
   - Example:
     ```python
     # and operator
     print((5 > 3) and (5 < 10))  # Output: True

     # or operator
     print((5 > 3) or (5 > 10))  # Output: True

     # not operator
     print(not(5 > 3))  # Output: False
     ```

4. **Assignment Operators**:
   - Used to assign values to variables.
   - Example:
     ```python
     # Simple assignment
     x = 5
     print(x)  # Output: 5

     # Add and assign
     x += 3
     print(x)  # Output: 8
     ```

5. **Membership Operators**:
   - Used to test whether a value or variable is found in a sequence (`string`, `list`, `tuple`, `set`, and `dictionary`).
   - Example:
     ```python
     # in operator
     print('a' in 'apple')  # Output: True

     # not in operator
     print('b' not in 'apple')  # Output: True
     ```

6. **Bitwise Operators**:
   - Used to perform bitwise calculations on integers.
   - Example:
     ```python
     # Bitwise AND
     print(5 & 3)  # Output: 1

     # Bitwise OR
     print(5 | 3)  # Output: 7
     ```

These examples should give you a good understanding of how different operators work in Python. Feel free to experiment with them to see how they operate! üêç‚ú®
