Some examples of type casting in Python:

1. **Integer to Float**:
   - Converting an integer to a floating-point number using the `float()` function.
   - Example:
     ```python
     x = 10
     y = float(x)
     print(y)  # Output: 10.0
     ```

2. **Float to Integer**:
   - Converting a floating-point number to an integer using the `int()` function.
   - Example:
     ```python
     x = 10.5
     y = int(x)
     print(y)  # Output: 10
     ```

3. **Integer to String**:
   - Converting an integer to a string using the `str()` function.
   - Example:
     ```python
     x = 5
     y = str(x)
     print(y)  # Output: '5'
     ```

4. **String to Float**:
   - Converting a string (representing a float) to a float using the `float()` function.
   - Example:
     ```python
     x = "5.9"
     y = float(x)
     print(y)  # Output: 5.9
     ```

5. **String to Integer**:
   - Converting a string (representing an integer) to an integer using the `int()` function.
   - Example:
     ```python
     x = "5"
     y = int(x)
     print(y)  # Output: 5
     ```

Remember that type casting allows you to convert data between different types, which can be useful in various scenarios! üêç‚ú®

## Real World Scenarios
Type casting is used in programming to ensure that variables are processed in a compatible format. Here are some real-world examples where type casting is essential:

1. **Handling User Input**:
   - When you receive input from a user, it's often in the form of a string. If you expect a number to perform calculations, you need to cast the string to an integer or float.
   - Example:
     ```python
     user_input = input("Enter a number: ")
     number = int(user_input)  # Casting string to integer
     print(number * 2)  # Now you can perform arithmetic operations
     ```

2. **Working with Databases**:
   - When interacting with databases, you might retrieve numeric data as strings. To perform any mathematical operations, you would need to cast these strings to the appropriate numeric type.
   - Example:
     ```python
     price = "19.99"  # Price is a string when fetched from a database
     price = float(price)  # Casting string to float
     total = price * quantity  # Now you can calculate the total cost
     ```

3. **Data Serialization**:
   - When sending data over a network or saving it to a file, you often need to convert complex data types to strings (serialization). Conversely, when reading this data, you need to cast it back to the original data type (deserialization).
   - Example:
     ```python
     import json

     # Serialization
     data = {"age": 30}
     serialized_data = json.dumps(data)  # Converts dictionary to a JSON string

     # Deserialization
     received_data = '{"age": "30"}'
     deserialized_data = json.loads(received_data)
     deserialized_data["age"] = int(deserialized_data["age"])  # Casting string to integer
     ```

4. **Ensuring Precision**:
   - When dealing with financial calculations, you might need to cast integers to floats to ensure that you don't lose precision during division.
   - Example:
     ```python
     total_cents = 550  # Total amount in cents
     dollars = total_cents / 100  # This will result in an integer division
     dollars = float(total_cents) / 100  # Casting to float for accurate division
     ```

5. **Graphics Programming**:
   - In graphics programming, you might need to cast floating-point coordinates to integers for pixel-based operations since pixels are discrete units.
   - Example:
     ```python
     x_coordinate = 150.7
     y_coordinate = 299.3
     draw_pixel(int(x_coordinate), int(y_coordinate))  # Casting float to int for pixel coordinates
     ```

These examples illustrate how type casting is used to convert data types to ensure proper handling and processing of variables in different programming scenarios¬π[1]¬≤[2]¬≥[3]‚Å¥[4]. üêç‚ú®


Banking Examples:

```python
# Suppose we have two bank accounts with different balances
account_balance_1 = 100  # This is an integer
account_balance_2 = 150  # This is also an integer

# We want to calculate the average balance between the two accounts
# If we do not cast to float, the division will perform integer division in Python 2.x
# or floor division in Python 3.x when using the '//' operator
average_balance = (account_balance_1 + account_balance_2) // 2

# The result will be an integer, which is not what we want for an average that could be a decimal
print("Average balance (incorrect due to integer division):", average_balance)

# To fix this, we should cast at least one of the operands to float before division
correct_average_balance = (account_balance_1 + account_balance_2) / 2.0

# Now the result will be a float, giving us the accurate average balance
print("Average balance (correct with float division):", correct_average_balance)
```

In this example, if we don't cast to float before performing the division, the program will truncate the decimal part, resulting in an incorrect average balance calculation. This can lead to significant discrepancies in financial reports and user account balances. Always ensure that financial calculations are performed with floating-point numbers to maintain precision.

 integer to a float in Python:

```python
# Assume we have a function to calculate interest on the provided balance and interest rate
def calculate_interest(balance, interest_rate):
    # If balance or interest_rate is not cast to float, the result might be incorrect
    return balance * interest_rate // 100

# Customer's account balance and the bank's interest rate
account_balance = 1000  # In dollars, as an integer
annual_interest_rate = 1.5  # Annual interest rate as a float

# Calculate the expected interest for one year
expected_interest = calculate_interest(account_balance, annual_interest_rate)

# The result will be incorrect due to integer division
print("Expected interest (incorrect due to integer division):", expected_interest)

# Correcting the function by casting balance to float
def calculate_correct_interest(balance, interest_rate):
    return balance * interest_rate / 100

# Calculate the correct interest for one year
correct_interest = calculate_correct_interest(account_balance, annual_interest_rate)

# Now the result will be correct
print("Expected interest (correct with float division):", correct_interest)
```

In this example, the `calculate_interest` function does not cast the `balance` to a float, which leads to integer division and an incorrect calculation of interest. This can cause a significant defect in a banking application where precise financial calculations are essential. The corrected function, `calculate_correct_interest`, properly casts the `balance` to a float, ensuring that the division is done correctly and the expected interest is calculated accurately.
