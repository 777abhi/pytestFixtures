1. **User-Defined Function**:
   - A user-defined function is created by the programmer to perform a specific task. It allows you to encapsulate a piece of code into a reusable block.
   - Example: Let's create a function that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.

     ```python
     def calculate_rectangle_area(length, width):
         """
         Calculates the area of a rectangle.
         Args:
             length (float): Length of the rectangle.
             width (float): Width of the rectangle.
         Returns:
             float: Area of the rectangle.
         """
         return length * width

     # Usage
     rectangle_length = 5
     rectangle_width = 3
     area = calculate_rectangle_area(rectangle_length, rectangle_width)
     print(f"The area of the rectangle is {area} square units.")
     ```

2. **Predefined Function**:
   - Predefined functions are built-in functions provided by Python. They serve various purposes and are readily available for use.
   - Example: Let's use the `len()` function to find the length of a list.

     ```python
     my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
     list_length = len(my_list)
     print(f"The length of the list is {list_length}.")
     ```

   - In this example, `len(my_list)` returns the number of elements in the list.
